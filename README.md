# commerce-data-eng-portfolio
This repository is a 90-day journey to showcase **real-world, commerce-scale data engineering projects**, built on Google Cloud and modern data stack tools.

## Projects
1. Real-time clickstream pipeline (Kafka â†’ Beam â†’ BigQuery)
2. Streaming ETL with SQL rules (Beam + Calcite)
3. Multi-pipeline orchestration (Airflow/Dagster + Grafana)
4. Real-time fraud detection (Beam + ML)
5. Kotlin Beam pipeline demo
6. Scale simulation (billion-row benchmarks)

## Timeline
ðŸ“… 12 weeks (Septâ€“Nov 2025)  
Each week delivers a new feature, pipeline, or blog post.

## Tech Stack
- Apache Beam (Python & Kotlin SDK)
- Kafka (local + cloud)
- BigQuery / Delta Lake
- Airflow or Dagster
- Grafana (monitoring)
- GCP Free Tier

Follow along as I build this out. The goal is to learn to build a data platform that can handle **scale, reliability, and adaptability** in commerce-like environments.
